            Standing tall, with a picturesque background adorning the green colours of the nature with its high raised buildings is the Koneru Lakshmaiah University, known for its unique style of education blended with culture. The campus has been aptly named "Green
            Fields" and the splendid avenue of trees and gardens bear testimony to the importance of ecology and environment providing the solace for scholastic pursuits. This university is the hub of knowledge fused with research experience. The life
            within the campus is filled with boisterous activities apart from academics. This apt encouragement resulted in students bringing laurels and fame all over. All students are given industrial exposure and made to interact with entrepreneurs
            and industrialists.

            SAMYAK
          </div>
          <div class="content_box_desc">
            Samyak is the biggest techno-management fete in all of Andhra Pradesh, which sees a confluence of students from all over the nation. This provides an avid opportunity for students to show their technical and cultural expertise and a platform to learn
            through practice. Filled with colours, painting the skies with fun and frolic, this two day fest drives home lessons of social responsibility apart from technical knowledge. One can witness the sun rise beautified with technical workshops
            setting away with awe and exuberance silencing after cultural extravaganza. Now seven years old, this fest is all set to enthral and captivate with all its prominence.

            THEME
          </div>
          <div class="content_box_desc">
            The fest is bound to a theme every year that projects the current situation. The theme adapted this year is START UP INDIA, STAND UP INDIA. This theme is adapted from a slogan coined by our honourable prime minister, Sri. Narendra Modi. This initiative
            was started to revive India’s economy, which is hugely dependent on home-grown industries. Our best hope are the youngsters of our nation – their ideas, their vision, their leadership and their start-ups. They are going to lead our economy
            into a new golden age. This year’s Samyak aims to inspire and encourage ideas that have the potential to create massive change, economically and socially.
