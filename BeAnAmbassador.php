                          To enact as a means of direct communication between Team SAMYAK and their respective colleges.<br>
                          The ambassador should see to it that there is maximum participation from the college in all the events and workshops hosted, which being the factor in deciding who gets to be a ‘Top Performer’.<br>
                          To represent their college at the Fest or in other words, to enact as a contingent leader of his colleagues.<br><br>
                          <b>PRIVILEGES:</b><br><br>

                          Campus ambassadors are prearranged with incentives such as goodies and free registration. Free hospitality will also be provided if they are one among the top performers.<br>
                          The tenure of a Campus ambassador is till the end of SAMYAK'16, but you can choose to be associated with the students of this University, which will in turn help them excel in their respective colleges or at least stand above the ones who choose not to be a part of this program.<br>
